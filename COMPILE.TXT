2. General
----------
Windows Version Test Tools is written using C++11 and is intended to be used on 
any 32-bit x86 and 64-bit x86-64 versions of Windows. General compilation
steps:

    1) Download sources from https://github.com/lcferrum/wvtt

    2) Compile it using makefile

    3) For older systems:

        a) Install MSVCRT (if not present)
		
        b) Install Win32s (if on Windows 3.1)

3. Specific compiling instructions
----------------------------------
Current distribution only supports MinGW-w64, MinGW 4.7.2 and Clang 3.6.2. If
you intend to use compiled binary on Windows 2000 and later, it is recommended
to compile using latest MinGW-w64 that can be installed through cygwin. The
problem is that MinGW-w64 produces binaries that use MSVCRT.DLL version
incompatible with NT 3.x-4, Windows 9x/Me and Win32s. If you want resulting
binaries to support those OSes, you should use old versions of MinGW or Clang
compilers. Latest MinGW version to support needed MSVCRT.DLL and needed minimal
processor architecture is 4.7.2. Recent versions of MinGW (5.3+) once again
started to support old MSVCRT.DLL versions, but default architecture is i586
now. So you need to rebuild GCC if you plan to use resulting binaries on the
whole variety of OS supported x86/x86-64 platforms (because linked GCC static
libs are already compiled for this default arch). Either way, MinGW versions
other than 4.7.2 are not supported by current distribution (though you may add
support by yourself). Latest pre-built Clang version to support MinGW 4.7.2 is
3.6.2. Other Clang versions are not supported by current distribution.

When using MinGW-w64 from under cygwin, switch to Windows Version Test Tools
source directory and type (for x86 build):

    make BUILD=MinGW-w64 HOST=x86
    
Or, for x86-64 build:

    make BUILD=MinGW-w64 HOST=x86-64
	
To build x86 binary with MinGW 4.7.2 type the following:

    make BUILD=MinGW_472 HOST=x86
	
Ordinary MinGW 4.7.2 x86 build supports only Win 9x/NT4 or newer. To support Win
NT3.x and Win 3.1 w/ Win32s you should make "maximum compatibility" x86 build:

    make BUILD=MinGW_472 HOST=x86_3X
    
x86_3X build is featurewise identical to x86, but has some additional
compatibility hacks enabled. For other compile options please check makefile
itself.
